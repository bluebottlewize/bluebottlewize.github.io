        <p>
            Years ago, Viktor was born in Zaun, growing up in a poor family and
            the polluted Undercity. Viktor was born with a limp in his right leg
            and was forced to walk around with a cane. This made it difficult
            for him to play with the other children, but despite his solitude
            and physical weakness, the young boy was brilliant and inventive,
            with a knack for constructing machines on the days he spent alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, when playing with a model boat in the river, Viktor
            stumbled upon an underground cave with a hidden lab. There, he met
            Singed, a Zaunite alchemist, who took an interest in the young boy's
            craftsmanship. While initially afraid of the old man, Viktor's
            curiosity got the better of him when he noticed a strange creature
            named Rio, which Singed described as a "rare mutation" that he was
            trying to save from death. Viktor, who quickly befriended the
            creature, offered to help Singed in his experiments, and the
            alchemist sent Viktor to collect materials for him. This partnership
            would not last long, however, as Viktor soon realized that Singed's
            method of keeping Rio alive had left her in a constant state of
            agony, torturing her with implants and potions to preserve the
            mutation's genetic material. The boy was horrified by this
            revelation and ran out of Singed's lab crying.
        </p>
        <p>
            Viktor is an idealistic, altruistic, genuis introvert with a passion
            for science and its ability to improve lives for the better. Growing
            up in the slums of Zaun as a poor, sick, crippled boy; Viktor
            understood the suffering everyday people had to endure by living in
            Zaun's terrible conditions. Viktor wanted to leave behind a legacy
            where he could improve the people of Zaun's lives and do good for
            all; he found a worthy outlet of this dream by pledging his support
            to Jayce's dream of bringing Hextech to the masses. Viktor would
            sometimes quarrel with Jayce when he feels he's being led astray or
            distracted from their shared dream of using hextech to improve
            lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Viktor believes that people are in desperate need of the good that
            hextech can provide and wants to make it accessible as hasty as
            possible. This sometimes leads to quarrels with Jayce and
            Heimerdinger, who've sometimes withheld hextech from the masses or
            halted its development until they could establish viable regulations
            for the new technology. Viktor is very bold in his pursuit of
            scientific discoveries and often is willing to do dangerous
            experimentation to figure it out or go against the ethos of the
            scientific community to accomplish his goals. To Viktor's credit, he
            has faith in himself and the genius to back it up. Part of the
            reason he is so hasty to usher in a hextech revolution is because of
            his short lifespan, and his dread that he will be unable to
            accomplish the meaningful good that his goals aspire to before he
            expires.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an introvert, Viktor is very shy and generally doesn't approach
            strangers for socializing. Even as a child, he was a loner and as a
            student of the Piltover Academy, he was an outsider who relied on
            his genius and grit to make something of himself. He often defers to
            Jayce to act as their spokesperson for public speaking events while
            he supports him from behind the scenes. Due to Viktor's inability to
            be a public figure, Viktor is often overshadowed by Jayce as a
            founding father of hextech. Viktor seems content to devote all his
            time on developing hextech and sees its progress and the
            popularization of the science as the most improtant use of his and
            Jayce's time; with socializing and other extracurricular activities
            being seen as a distraction. Viktor sometimes becomes so immersed in
            his work that he becomes a reclusive workaholic.
